# IslandProblem
Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 3 islands.

grid = [

  ["1","1","0","0","0"],

  ["1","1","0","0","0"],

  ["0","0","1","0","0"],

  ["0","0","0","1","1"]]

BfS and DFS algorithms have been employed to solve this problem in two different approaches.
